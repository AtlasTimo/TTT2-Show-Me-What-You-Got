## Description
If you have ever seen Rick an Morty, you will know, what this is abaut. But you don´t need to dance or sing to satisfy the head, but you´ll need to offer him some weapons! More valuable weapons will be more satisfying.

### ❗️Important❗️
**I highly recommend to install ZenBreakers Weapon Base additionally. The Loot Value this addon provides makes a solid base to evaluate the offered weapons:** https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2402081204

## How to Use
Shoot to eject the Head, wich will fly in the direction you look to.
The head will stop if it hits a wall or flies to far.
After the head has stopped, everyone targeted by it will need to offer some weapons or items.
If you are targeted by the head, you will see a icon with a timer on the left side of your screen.
To offer a weapon, just look at the head and drop it.
Based on the sum of the loot value offered, the head will decide to kill or not.
